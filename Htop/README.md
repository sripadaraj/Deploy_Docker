## Htop :

>Htop is an interactive system-monitor process-viewer and process-manager. It is designed as an alternative to the Unix program top.
 It shows a frequently updated list of the processes running on a computer, normally ordered by the amount of CPU usage. Unlike top, 
 htop provides a full list of processes running, instead of the top resource-consuming processes. 
 Htop uses color and gives visual information about processor, swap and memory status.
